    The Ansible restconf_config module is used for each play (task), which yang data model used might differ between the plays.

    i.e. a "deleted" event will result in a "delete" task being executed. Appropriate parameters for the event are also specified in the task,

    """
    This functions runs when receiving a webhook.
    Below is the flask app code that receives the webhook.
    Calls the functions responsible for each step.
    If a function returns a value of None, the webhook wont be processed futher.
    In the code this is represented as a "return Response(=200)", which is a 
    HTTP response to the HTTP webhook POST. 
    Functions and terms are further explained in conjunction with the functions
    
    First of all the received webhook is stored in a variable and
    some of its' important parts are stored in other variables.
    These variables are used in different functions to extract data.

    Step 1 calls the function "check_model" which uses the "model"
    part of the webhook in order to check if the model is configurable.
    This is arbitrarily predetermined in the dict "list_of_models".
    If model is determined to be configurable the "event" value of the webhook
    is saved to be processed in step 2. Undetermined configurability will end the process.

    Step 2 compares the different events in the webhook. If event is "updated" then the function "compare()"
    is called, which compares the "prechange" part of the webhook with the "postchange" part.
    The differences between the pre- and postchange are saved in the "values" variable.
    If the event is "created" the "postchange" is saved in "values".
    If the event is "deleted" the "prechange" is saved in "values".

    Step 3 configurable values are selected by calling the "pick_out_values()" function with the arguments
    "data", "model" and "values". The function will also return a url to a device in Netbox when "model" is not "device".
    If no configurable values can be selected, the process end.

    Step 4 depending on what model is being configured the retrieval of ip address differ. If the model is "device" the 
    address is included in the webhook, otherwise the url to the device has to be used and then via Netbox API retrieve the 
    address from the device. If the device doesnt have a primary ip address assigned to it, the process will end.

    Step 5 is the last step. Calls the "run_playbook()" function in order to create and run an Ansible playbook with data from previous steps.
    The configuration will be saved on the device. The function only offers full support for Cisco IOS XE devices. For other devices support might vary.
